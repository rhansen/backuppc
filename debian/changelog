backuppc (4.2.1) stable; urgency=medium
  * Merged pull request #195.
  * Added new config variable $Conf{CgiUserDeleteBackupEnable} that
    sets whether users and admins can delete backups via the CGI
    interface. The default value is 0, which means it's disabled
    for regular users but available for admins.
  * Fixed delete backup bug in bin/BackupPC_Admin_SCGI reported by
    Julian Zielke in issue #193.
  * Added check to dirCacheFlush() in bin/BackupPC_tarExtract to skip files
    that don't have attributes; reported by Tarak Patel.
  * Removed extraneous duplicate variable assignment in lib/BackupPC/CGI/GeneralInfo.pm,
    from @moisseev (#195).
